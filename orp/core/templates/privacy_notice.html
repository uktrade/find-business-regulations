                <p>This privacy notice explains how the Department for Business and Trade (DBT), as a 'data controller',
                    processes personal data for the 'Check when large businesses pay their suppliers' service on GOV.UK.
                </p>
                <p>This notice is supplemented by our <a href="https://www.great.gov.uk/privacy-and-cookies/"
                        class="govuk-link"><u>main privacy notice</u></a> which provides further information on how DBT
                    processes personal data, and sets out your rights in respect of that personal data.</p>

                <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Personal data DBT collects</h2>
                <p>DBT collects information about:</p>
                <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                    <li>individuals filing payment practice reports on behalf of businesses</li>

                        organisation</li>

                    <li>email addresses</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Why DBT asks for this information and what happens if it is not provided
                </h2>
                <p>DBT collects this information to meet its obligations under 'The Reporting on Payment Practices and
                    Performance Regulations 2017', which requires qualifying UK businesses to report on their payment
                    practices.
                </p>
                <p>The 'Check when large businesses pay their suppliers' service is provided by DBT to enable this
                    reporting to take place. Personal data is collected through this service to:</p>
                <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                    <li>identify individuals filing reports on behalf of businesses</li>
                    <li>send confirmation emails and reminders to individuals filing reports on behalf of businesses
                    </li>
                    <li>record and publish the names of company directors who have approved the payment practice reports
                        for their organisation</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This personal data must be provided by all qualifying businesses to meet their legal obligations
                    under the regulations.</p>

                <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">The legal basis for processing your personal data</h2>
                <p>The legal bases for processing your personal data (Article 6(1) UK General Data Protection Regulation
                    (GDPR)) are that:</p>
                <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                    <li>processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is
                        subject</li>
                    <li>processing is necessary for a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of
                        official authority vested in the controller</li>
                </ul>
                <p>In some instances, we may process your data further for a compatible purpose and/or on other legal
                    bases. For example, your data may be used for archiving, research and/or statistical purposes. These
                    are compatible purposes for further processing in UK GDPR and your data will be subject to
                    appropriate safeguards if used for such purposes.</p>

                <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">How DBT processes personal data it receives</h2>
                <p>Once received:</p>
                <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                    <li>your data will be stored within the 'Check when large businesses pay their suppliers' service
                    </li>
                    <li>names of company directors will be published openly as part of the business' payment practice
                        reports. Publication may take place through a range of DBT digital channels</li>
                    <li>your data may also be processed within other DBT internal digital and data systems</li>

                </ul>

                <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Information sharing</h2>
                <p>In addition to the open publishing of company director names, we may share personal data you provide:

                    <li>where we are ordered to do so or where we are otherwise required to do so by law</li>
                    <li>with third party data processors as governed by contract</li>
                </ul>

                </p>

                <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">How long will DBT hold your data for</h2>
                <p>DBT will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected
                    it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.
                </p>
                <p>Names of company directors will be retained indefinitely.</p>
                <p>Email addresses of individuals who file reports will be retained for 10 years.</p>
                <p>If we decide that we need to process your personal data for a reason which is incompatible with the
                    purposes for which we collected it for, we will contact you to explain why we are doing this and why
                    it is lawful to do so.</p>
                <p>To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and
                    sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of
                    your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve
                    those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.</p>
